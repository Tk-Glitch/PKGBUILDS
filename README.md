## How-to use this mess :

### While some of the scripts might work fine on any distro, the PKGBUILDs will only work on distros with access to pacman and makepkg.
**If you need to access pacman and makepkg outside of Arch-linux and distros based on it (like Antergos or Manjaro), you can "hijack" your current distro with Bedrock Linux at your own risk: https://bedrocklinux.org**  

 * Clone the whole thing (that enables you to use `git submodule update --remote` to get updates) :
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Tk-Glitch/PKGBUILDS.git
```

 * You can also choose to clone only the repos you need. All submodules can be found here: https://github.com/Frogging-Family

 * Build packages :

From the directory of the package you want to build (where the PKGBUILD is located), run
```
makepkg -si
```
That will grab the required dependencies, build, then install the newly created package(s).


 * For bash scripts, just run them from their respective directory - You might find additional details in the readme dedicated to the tool you want to build.

 * For your convenience, a script is available in the root of PKGBUILDS to pull updates and create external configuration files easily: `./TkgThingy`


## Why aren't the PKGBUILDs on AUR ?! :

While some are already available there without userpatches or lib32 support, the most interesting ones aren't (namely linux kernels, nvidia-all and wine-tkg-git) because of the way they are working. You're prompted for options or even config file editing to get the package customized the way you want it to be. For nvidia-all, there's no way around it so I'd consider that non-AUR compliant by default. For linux kernels and wine-tkg-git, I could indeed provide a fixed preset and remove all prompts. That would work. But then, are these still as interesting without customization? I strongly believe they aren't.


### Daily builds (pacman packages) for most packages are available at Chaotic-AUR (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#chaotic-aur):
- Always up to date instructions on how to add Chaotic-AUR as repo can be found at [https://aur.chaotic.cx](https://aur.chaotic.cx) - Thanks Pedro !
