# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Wine-TkG config file

#### COMPILER/BUILD OPTIONS ####

# Compiler choice - Supports "gcc", "gcc7" (bug 45199), "clang" and "zapcc" options
_COMPILEWITH="gcc"

# Set to true to build optimized binaries using predefined flags set in the PKGBUILD. All CPU threads will also be used for building independently of your settings.
# Setting this to false will use your system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf. If you're planning to share the resulting package, set to false (as -march=native would be used)
_LOCAL_OPTIMIZED="true"

# Set to true to auto-nuke pbasrcdir, esyncsrcdir and srcdir symlinks. They need to be deleted for sanity sake to prevent patch failures. Set to false for debugging.
_NUKR="true"

# Set to true if you do not want to compile your build after its source is ready - For source sharing/debugging
_NOCOMPILE="false"

# Set to true if you want to skip the initial prompt
_NOINITIALPROMPT="false"

# Set to a string of your choice to override the default dynamic pkgname. Example: "awkward_frog" will result in "wine-tkg-git-awkward_frog" pkgname. You can also use "none" to only get a plain "wine-tkg-git" pkgname.
_PKGNAME_OVERRIDE=""

# Set to true to install into /opt/wine-something instead of /usr; this allows you to install multiple different versions in parallel
# Don't forget that you'll have to use /opt/wine-something/bin/wine instead of just wine (same for winecfg etc.)
_INSTALL_TO_OPT="false"
