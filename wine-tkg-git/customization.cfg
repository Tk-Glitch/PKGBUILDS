_LOCAL_OPTIMIZED="true"
# Custom GCC flags to use instead of system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf. Default is "-pipe -O2 -ftree-vectorize". Don't use -march=native if you want to share your builds accross different machines!

_PKGNAME_OVERRIDE=""


#### EXTERNAL INSTALLATION SETTINGS ####

_EXTERNAL_INSTALL="false"

# "opt" path
_DEFAULT_EXTERNAL_PATH="/opt"
