# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Wine-TkG config file


#### COMPILER/BUILD OPTIONS ####

# External config file to use - If the given file exists in path, it will override default config (customization.cfg) - Default is ~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg
_EXT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/frogminer/wine-tkg.cfg

# Override config with one of the presets from /wine-tkg-profiles dir.
# Lutris presets : "lutris-fo4", "lutris-legacy", "lutris-mwo", "lutris-sims2", "lutris-oldnvidia-sims3", "lutris-protonified", "lutris-unity", "lutris".
# Clean presets (untouched) : "mainline", "staging".
_LOCAL_PRESET=""

# Compiler choice - Supports "gcc", "gcc7" (bug 45199), "clang" and "zapcc" options. "gcc" is the default and recommended option.
_COMPILEWITH="gcc"

# Set to true to use custom flags defined by _GCC_FLAGS (for GCC) or _CLANG_FLAGS (for Clang and Zapcc). All CPU threads will also be used for building independently of your settings.
# Setting this to false will use your system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf.
_LOCAL_OPTIMIZED="true"
# Custom GCC flags to use instead of system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf. Default is "-pipe -O2 -ftree-vectorize -ftree-slp-vectorize".
_GCC_FLAGS="-pipe -O2 -ftree-vectorize -ftree-slp-vectorize"
# Custom Clang and Zapcc flags to use instead of system-wide makepkg flags set in /etc/makepkg.conf. Default is "-pipe -O3" ("-std=gnu89 -g" will also be passed for these compilers).
_CLANG_FLAGS="-pipe -O3"
# Optionally set -march flag's value. Default is "native" to let the compiler decide. If you're planning to share the resulting package, leave empty.
_OPTIONAL_MARCHFLAG="native"

# You can optionally uncomment the _NO_MSGS_FLAGS="true" option to disable trace and debug messages, reducing binary size by about 10%, and possibly some overhead. Please don't post issues with such a build on winehq though, you're on your own here.
#_NO_MSGS_FLAGS="true"

# By default, tests are disabled to speed up compilation. If you need them for development purposes, set to "true"
_ENABLE_TESTS="false"

# Set to "debug" to enable incremental building for debugging/development. Set to "false" to skip cleanups. Default "true" will enable housecleaning and sanity tasks.
_NUKR="true"

# Set to true to disable 32-bit wine. Doing so will disable WoW64 and break ALL 32-bit apps. Default is "false".
_NOLIB32="false"

# Set to true if you do not want to compile your build after its source is ready - For source sharing/debugging
_NOCOMPILE="false"

# Set to true if you want to skip the initial prompt
_NOINITIALPROMPT="false"

# Set to a string of your choice to override the default dynamic pkgname. Example: "awkward_frog" will result in "wine-tkg-git-awkward_frog" pkgname. You can also use "none" to only get a plain "wine-tkg-git" pkgname.
_PKGNAME_OVERRIDE=""


#### EXTERNAL INSTALLATION SETTINGS ####

# Set to true to install into external path instead of /usr. This allows you to install multiple different versions in parallel. Supports "opt" and "lutris" sub-options.
# !!! For "opt", don't forget that you'll have to use /opt/wine-something/bin/wine instead of just wine (same for winecfg etc.) !!!
_EXTERNAL_INSTALL="false"

# Either "opt" or "lutris". Default paths are /opt/wine-something for "opt" and $HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/wine-something for "Lutris". "Lutris" will target current user's home folder at build time ;)
_EXTERNAL_INSTALL_TYPE="lutris"

# "opt" path
_DEFAULT_EXTERNAL_PATH="/opt"
# "lutris" path
_LUTRIS_RUNNERS_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine"

# Set to true to disable versioning in path for external install. For example, this would strip "opt/wine-tkg-opt-git-4.0.r11.gd2a48f1a" to "opt/wine-tkg-opt-git".
_EXTERNAL_NOVER="false"


#### WINE FLAVOUR SETTINGS ####

_staging_version=""
# You can optionally uncomment the _staging_userargs="" option to disable desired wine-staging patchsets.
# For example, to disable the 'wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending' patchset, the line below would look like this : _staging_userargs="-W wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending"
# You can also disable multiple patchsets ('wined3d-WINED3D_RS_COLORWRITEENABLE' and 'wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending' in the following example : _staging_userargs="-W wined3d-WINED3D_RS_COLORWRITEENABLE -W wined3d-Indexed_Vertex_Blending"

_use_pba="true"

# vkd3d - Use the currently installed vkd3d packages (both 32 and 64-bit) for d3d12 to vulkan translation - If they aren't (both) installed, vkd3d won't be used
