# Wine to rule them all !

## DO NOT REPORT BUGS ENCOUNTERED WITH CUSTOM BUILDS AT WINEHQ, REPORT HERE INSTEAD !

This pkgbuild allows you to create custom wine builds using an opt-in mechanism (by editing the customization.cfg file). You can now easily get the "plain wine + pba + steam fix" build you've been dreaming about. Lutris "tkg" (previously esync-staging-pba) builds are created using this pkgbuild - https://github.com/lutris/wine

You can now turn your wine-tkg-git builds to Steamplay compatible and use them directly from Steam! - https://github.com/Tk-Glitch/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/proton-tkg

**Since this is a -git package, wine and wine-staging sources will be pulled from latest master branches by default. You can define specific releases commit in the cfg file if needed.**

*Can be built with DXVK winelib prebaked (replacing wined3d for d3d10 and d3d11 support)* - https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk

*Can be built with D9VK winelib prebaked (replacing wined3d for d3d9 support)* - https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk

*Can be built with VKD3D for D3D12 support (using https://github.com/Tk-Glitch/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/vkd3d-git is recommended)* - https://source.winehq.org/git/vkd3d.git

*Can be built with Faudio (requires both faudio and lib32-faudio packages installed)* - https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FAudio

**Can also be built with your own patches - See [README in ./wine-tkg-userpatches](wine-tkg-userpatches/README.md) for instructions**
